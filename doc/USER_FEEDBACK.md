#User FeedBack

## Editor
1. It is not very clear that the user needs to drag the character on to the screen to begin viewing the attributes
2. Attribute overhaul - The selected attributes and its corresponding values on the world is not clear. I don't know what refers to what easily.
3. There are too many values to edit which makes it a bit overwhelming
4. Put similar attributes close to each other.
5. What do some of the editable fields mean?
6. KeyBinding options should be clearer
7. The Tag, Subtag, and Title are not clear. Rename. Possible use a plus button to add a new option.
8. Menu Bar and Drag is confused initially
9. What is the next step afterwards to starting the saved game?
10. Help?

## Player
1. Make the connection between the editor and the player clearer and cleaner.
2. Headsup display
3. Map view is not clear
